    """
    Synchronizes a Google Cloud Storage bucket with an S3 bucket.

    .. seealso::
        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator:GCSToS3Operator`

    :param bucket: The Google Cloud Storage bucket to find the objects. (templated)
    :param prefix: Prefix string which filters objects whose name begin with
        this prefix. (templated)
    :param delimiter: (Deprecated) The delimiter by which you want to filter the objects. (templated)
        For e.g to lists the CSV files from in a directory in GCS you would use
        delimiter='.csv'.
    :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
    :param dest_aws_conn_id: The destination S3 connection
    :param dest_s3_key: The base S3 key to be used to store the files. (templated)
    :param dest_verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
        By default SSL certificates are verified.
        You can provide the following values:

        - ``False``: do not validate SSL certificates. SSL will still be used
                 (unless use_ssl is False), but SSL certificates will not be
                 verified.
        - ``path/to/cert/bundle.pem``: A filename of the CA cert bundle to uses.
                 You can specify this argument if you want to use a different
                 CA cert bundle than the one used by botocore.

    :param replace: Whether or not to verify the existence of the files in the
        destination bucket.
        By default is set to False
        If set to True, will upload all the files replacing the existing ones in
        the destination bucket.
        If set to False, will upload only the files that are in the origin but not
        in the destination bucket.
    :param google_impersonation_chain: Optional Google service account to impersonate using
        short-term credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
    :param s3_acl_policy: Optional The string to specify the canned ACL policy for the
        object to be uploaded in S3
    :param keep_directory_structure: (Optional) When set to False the path of the file
         on the bucket is recreated within path passed in dest_s3_key.
    :param match_glob: (Optional) filters objects based on the glob pattern given by the string
        (e.g, ``'**/*/.json'``)
